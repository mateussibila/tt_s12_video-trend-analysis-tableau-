# Video Trend Analysis – Tableau Dashboard

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes YouTube trending videos data to identify which categories gain the most visibility, how trends vary across different countries, and which categories are especially popular.

The dashboard was developed as part of the TripleTen Data Analytics Bootcamp (Sprint 12) and is fully interactive, allowing filtering by date and region.
